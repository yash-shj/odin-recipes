# Odin Recipes

A simple multipage website created using basic HTML tags.

- `<h1>`, `<h2>`: For main and subheadings.
- `<ul>`, `<ol>`, `<li>`: To create unordered and ordered lists.
- `<a>`: For creating links to navigate between different pages.
- `<img>`: To display images with attributes like `src`, `alt`, and `height`.
- `<p>`: For paragraphs.

Developing this website helped me understand the basics of structuring and linking simple web pages.
